# Why?

I recently ran into an issue on Docker Swarm and did have backups in place for my [BookstackApp instance](https://www.bookstackapp.com/), so I wrote a small bash script to help me out. Thought it might help someone else in the future. Really elementary my dear Watson.

All the variables used are listed in the file itself. 

Enjoy!
